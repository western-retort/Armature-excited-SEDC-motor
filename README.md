Armature_excited SEDC motor simulation model by Vishal M. J.   . 
This is just a simulation from his video oin youtube:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNbG4nZeEXE
All credits due him but as as many people use it for a start for motor simulation ive created his model here.
There are 2 files .m and the pother for simulink . Need to have simscape installed . .m file has all the params in it to run the simulation . 
in command window run "Command Window" so to save the params in .m file and then just ctrl+t the .slx file.
